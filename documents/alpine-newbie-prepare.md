.. firs of all.. When starting to learn something, you should weigh 
your capabilities and availability of resources:

## 1 - Check requirements

We are persons, [we have real life requirements](#real-life-requirements) 
and after [we need related requirements](#related-requirements).

### Real life requirementes

* **Manners**, you will must have a vocation for reading and analysis.
* **Time**, you will need time, cos you will need to read a lot!
* **Device**, you should have a computer, or phone at least, or similar, by example using [Termux or IOs for phones](alpine-tutorial-in-phones.md) 

### Related requirementes

* **Knowledge** have knowledge of using linux, git and editors
    * **vi/nano** you must know how to use VI and NANO editors, just write and save are enought
    * **LFSH** you must read about the linux filesystem hierarchy, just where the files should go
    * **git** you must know minimal usage of git, just clone and pull are enought
* **Unix-like**, you should have some kind of way to interact with a UNIX like operating system, like MAC or Linux.
    * **xterm** you must know how to use, cpy/paste text and manage a terminal command line
    * **ssh** you ust know how to use SSH at the comand line
* **Internet**, and minimal bandwitch of internet network.. cos almost today all the development will forced to you to contribute over internet.

## 2 - Where to start

Please, check requirements mentioned above, before continues; **this material 
(newbie sections) assumes a more general level and helps you to follow the steps more slowly:
**Of course the first document to read is [alpine-newbie-install.md](alpine-newbie-install.md).**
and then **after install read [alpine-newbie-xfce-desktop.md](alpine-newbie-xfce-desktop.md)**

But for more focused guides, the requirements mentioned above are mandatory, 
without them you will not be able to understand the documents at the [../tutorials/](../tutorials/) 
directory space, **guides or tutorials will assume you already have those knowledge requirements**.

### WARNING

* First of all, if you do not use Linux before, this is not a "click click click" environment
* Second: if you comes from other Linux, there are a huge difference respect others: MUSL libc!

Al of those means that most of the programs may need manual intervention of precompilation.
IF you plan to use Alpine Linux as desktop maybe you will find a difficult path but, 
its totally workable, and also pretty best performed. Alpine its best know for usage over containers, 
like dockers or virtual machines.
