Alpine Linux tutorias and howtos
=================================

The **tutorials are hands-on docs** expected to try and achieve the goals described 
in each step, possibly with the help of a good example. The output in one step 
is the starting point for the following steps.

The **Howtos are smaller articles** explaining how to perform a particular task 
with Alpine Linux, that expects a minimal knowledge from reader to perform actions. 

The **Guides are fast documents** with only direct ways to do a particular task
with Alpine Linux, that expects a minimal knowledge from reader to perform actions. 

## TUTORIALS AND HOWTOS

We divided the guides, tutorials and howtos in 3 main sections (directories):

1. [newbies](../newbies/README.md) (formal ways of doing things but with explanations, mostly for begginers)
2. [community-way](community-way/README.md) (quick, fast and forward ways of doing things, mostly for impatients)
3. [professional-way](professional-way/README.md) (informal ways but with more explanations and implicit security)

## Acknowledges

**CONSIDERATIONS**: Please check the [Feature Differences OF ALPINE LINUX](../newbies/README.md#feature-differences) 
but those are the main ones you should considering before usage of Alpine linux:

1. Alpine Linux **is designed for power users, with security and simplicity in mind**.
2. Alpine Linux **is not for newbies most knowed as new baby users or windosers**.
3. It is built around musl libc, not glibc, which means there might be incompatibilites with some packages
4. Its main utilities (coreutils) are derived from busybox and suckless, so all commands are pretty simplistic

**PREREQUISITES**: Please check the [newbie alpine preparation requirements for you](../newbie/alpine-newbie-prepare.md) 
but you can use linux using [termux](tutorial-alpine-in-phone.md) or [ish](tutorial-alpine-in-phone.md) on your phone.

* **Manners**, you will must have a vocation for reading and analysis.
* **Time**, you will need time, cos you will need to read a lot!
* **Computer**, you should **have a pc, or phone**, and must have a UNIX like operating system, like MAC/IOS or Androit/Linux
* **Internet**, and minimal bandwitch of internet network..
