Alpine Linux tutorias and how tos
=================================

This category section will try to guide new ones with almost basic enought knowledge of Linux.

**CONSIDERATIONS**: Please check the [Feature Differences OF THIS ALPINE LINUX](../newbies/README.md#feature-differences) 
but those are the main ones you should considering before usage of Alpine linux:

1. Alpine Linux **is designed for power users, with security and simplicity in mind**.
2. Alpine Linux **is not for newbies most knowed as new baby users or windosers**.
3. It is built around musl libc, not glibc, which means there might be incompatibilites with some packages
4. Its main utilities (coreutils) are derived from busybox and suckless, so all commands are pretty simplistic

**PREREQUISITES**: Please check the [newbie alpine preparation requirements for you](../newbie/alpine-newbie-prepare.md) 
but you can use linux using [termux](tutorial-alpine-in-phone.md) or [ish](tutorial-alpine-in-phone.md) on your phone.

* **Manners**, you will must have a vocation for reading and analysis.
* **Time**, you will need time, cos you will need to read a lot!
* **Computer**, you should **have a pc, or phone**, and must have a UNIX like operating system, like MAC/IOS or Androit/Linux
* **Internet**, and minimal bandwitch of internet network..
