Community way of alpine wiki documentation
=========================================

The **tutorials are hands-on docs** expected to try and achieve the goals described 
in each step, possibly with the help of a good example. The output in one step 
is the starting point for the following steps.

The **Howtos are smaller articles** explaining how to perform a particular task 
with Alpine Linux, that expects a minimal knowledge from reader to perform actions. 

Those documents are community made and may or not may have updated.
For more up to date documents check [the main index at tutorials/README.md](../README.md)
