.. firs of all.. when you start to learn something you should check your available resources agains the needs .. 

## requirements

We are persons, so first of all [we have real life requirements](#real-life-requirements) 
and after [we need related requirements](#related-requirements).

You as future contributor or developer must check your resources and adapt those to your situation.. 
that seems unrelated to learning but ITS VERY IMPORTANT! Why?: well cos in linux and development 
you shoul READ A LOT .. and that will waste time from your life.

### Real life requirementes

* **Manners**, you will must have a vocation for reading and analysis.
* **Time**, you will need time, cos you will need to read a lot!
* **Computer**, you should have a pc, or similar, by example most of the people uses the androit phone to handle an internal linux using [termux](termux-pending-file.md) 

### Related requirementes

* **Knowledge** you will need a knowed editor, a god knowledge of git as minimal base..
* **Internet**, and minimal bandwitch of internet network.. cos almost today all the development will forced to you to contribute over internet.
* **Unix-like**, you should have some kind of way to interact with a UNIX like operating system, like MAC or Linux.
